# hello-world
## My name is Micaela Brown. 
I'm 27 years old and work in non-profit. I'm interested in Code:You because I'm looking into growing in the data analytics field. I got married in March of this year and just bought a house with my husband. We recently adopted a black lab/border collie mix named *Captain Levi*.
